## Very simple RCON Maui tool to control your local CS2 Server. 

Code is quite messy, put this up in few hours and its mostly created using CoPilot. 

But does what its supposed to without relying some random 3rd party app. 

You can actually see the code that its clean, rather than most of the other applications done for this purpose. 

.NET 8 Maui 

#Features: 
- Multiple server support
- Basic RCON Commands such as change level, load workshop map, kick, ban, warmup end, yada yada.
- Feel free to create PR's
